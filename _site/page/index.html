<h1 id="kyle-mahowald">Kyle Mahowald</h1>
<p><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/assets/img/kyle_mahowald.png" /></span></p>

<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>

<p><span class="newthought">Originally from Florida,</span>  I am now a graduate student in <a href="http://tedlab.mit.edu/">Ted Gibson’s psycholinguistics lab</a> in MIT’s<span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/assets/img/mit.png" /></span> Brain and Cognitive Sciences department. Before that, I was a Marshall Scholar at Oxford University studying linguistics under the supervision of Mary Dalrymple and Aditi Lahiri. And before that I was an undergrad at Harvard. I am interested in how and why languages change (both syntactically and at the level of the word), the organizational structure of the lexicon (i.e., why we have the words we have instead of some other set of words), the relationship between communicative efficiency and natural language, historical English, language neuroimaging, and lexical-functional grammar.</p>

<h2 id="about-me-1">About ‘me’</h2>

<p>Me is the first person object pronoun in English. It goes back to the accusative and dative in Old English and before that to an Indo-European pronoun that would probably remind you of me. If you’re ever bored, feel free to try it as an exclamation, as in “Oh, me!”</p>

<h3 id="posts">Posts</h3>

<p>Conceptually, posts are for recurring pieces of similar content such as might be found in a typical blog entry. Post content all sits in a folder named <code>_posts</code> and files are created in this folder<sup class="sidenote-number">1</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup class="sidenote-number">1</sup> Yes, a page has essentially the same old shit as a post</span> that are names with a date pre-pended to the title of the post. For instance <code>2105-02-20-this-is-a-post.md</code> is a perfectly valid post filename.</p>

<p>Posts will always have a section above the content itself consisting of YAML front matter, which is meta-data information about the post. Minimally, a post title must always be present for it to be processed properly.</p>

<pre><code>---
Title: Some Title
---
## Content

Markdown formatted content *here*.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="pages">Pages</h3>

<p>Pages are any HTML documents <em>or</em> Markdown documents with YAML front matter that are then converted to content. Page material is more suited to static, non-recurring types of content. Like this</p>

<p>I am not going to re-write the Jekyll documentation. Read it and you will figure out how the site is structured.</p>
