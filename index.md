## About me

{% newthought 'Originally from Florida,'%} I am now a graduate student in [Ted Gibson's psycholinguistics lab](http://tedlab.mit.edu/) in MIT's Brain and Cognitive Sciences department. Before that, I was a Marshall Scholar at Oxford University studying linguistics under the supervision of [Mary Dalrymple](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~cpgl0015/) and [Aditi Lahiri](http://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/lahiri). And before that I was an undergrad in English at Harvard.{% sidenote 1 'About *me*: *Me* is the first person object pronoun in English. It goes back to the accusative and dative in Old English and before that to an Indo-European pronoun that would probably remind you of me.'%}

## Research

{% newthought 'I am interested'%} in the structure of the lexicons of world languages (i.e., why we have the words we have instead of some other set of words), the relationship between communicative efficiency and natural language, historical English, language neuroimaging, literature, and the interplay between language and literature. I also have interests in quantitative methods in language research.

{% marginfigure assets/img/meta_plot.png 'Mahowald et al. "A meta-analysis of Syntactic Priming" analyzed 71 syntactic priming papers and found a robust effect of syntactic priming that was greatly magnified by lexical boost. This plot shows model coefficients for various moderators of the priming effect.' %} K. Mahowald, A. James, R. Futrell, E. Gibson. Submitted. A meta-analysis of syntactic priming.

In this plot, each point is a word, and a line is used to connect any two words that are one edit away in phonetic space. The real lexicon is more tightly clustered than the baseline models.' %}K.
